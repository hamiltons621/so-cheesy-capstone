# BLOCK. Charcuterie Maker ðŸ§€

Block. Charcuterie Maker, built using React, allows users to build \
a charcuterie board and save it to their profile. Users are presented \
with all the ingredients in an easy to use multi-select form. \
Ingredients are stored in a board to access any time they log in. \
They can savor their favorite ingredients and boards, & shelf the \
ones they didnâ€™t love. Users can add and remove friends while \
accessing, liking and disliking their friendsâ€™ boards.
